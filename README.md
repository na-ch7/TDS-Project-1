- I used GitHubâ€™s API to collect Paris-based users with over 200 followers, retrieves each user's detailed data and repositories, and saves the data in CSV files.

- Developers seeking recognition could focus on freelance, open-source projects, and diversifying their skills to match the wide array of technologies used.
